Sure, here's a README file for a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity in Python:
markdownCopy code# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity in Python. The system analyzes the plot summaries of movies to find similar movies based on the content and provides recommendations to users.

## Features

- Reads movie data from a CSV file
- Preprocesses the movie plot summaries using natural language processing techniques
- Generates a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix for the plot summaries
- Calculates the cosine similarity between movies based on their TF-IDF vectors
- Recommends similar movies based on the user's input movie

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bashCopy codecd movie-recommender

Install the required packages:

bashCopy codepip install -r requirements.txt

Download the necessary NLTK data:

pythonCopy codeimport nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Usage

Prepare the movie data in a CSV file with columns for movie titles and plot summaries.
Run the recommender.py script:

bashCopy codepython recommender.py

Enter the title of a movie when prompted.
The script will output a list of recommended movies based on the similarity of their plot summaries to the input movie.

Files

recommender.py: The main script that runs the recommender system.
utils.py: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and similarity calculation.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages for the project.
movie_data.csv: A sample CSV file containing movie data (title and plot summary).
